Features

This release contains the following features and improvements:

Tables
======

Brightspot 3.2 adds a new Tables feature to the Rich Text Editor, allowing you to easily enrich your content with tables. Add tables to your content in three general ways:

* Create a table directly in the Rich Text Editor: Click the "Table" button in the Rich Text Editor toolbar. The default table is one row high and two columns wide.
* Copy and paste a table: The Rich Text Editor will accept tables copied from most sources, including Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, Apple Numbers, and rendered HTML tables.
* Create an HTML table: Write your table in raw HTML in the Rich Text Editor, select your code, and click the "Raw HTML" button, or write it in HTML mode.

All features of the Brightspot Rich Text Editor are available in tables, including links, enhancements, text formatting, and change tracking. For more information, please see the Tables chapter.

Rich Text Editor Improvements
=============================

Brightspot's Rich Text Editor is even better in 3.2. Anchor links are now supported in your text, and links you paste from other sources can now be edited to add click tracking or other parameters.

Search Improvements
===================

You can now multi-select images in grid view by clicking anywhere on the image. Search will now offer you options to create new content based on the content you've chosen. For example, if you've chosen multiple images, Brightspot will offer a "Create New Gallery" button. You can also save your multi-selected content as a Selection, which you can return to later, use for bulk actions, or convert into a Workstream.

Dashboard Improvements
======================

The Dashboard is your homepage for working in Brightspot, and 3.2 makes it more flexible than ever. You can now choose specific content to keep in your Common Content widget's Edit Existing section for easy access to the content you edit the most or need to edit again in the future. You can also control which widgets are associated with your content types. The new Selections widget allows you to view or share others' Selections. The Workstreams widget can now be filtered, and will only display 10 Workstreams per page. For more infomration, see the Dashboard chapter.

Interface Improvements
======================

Text fields now support Find and Replace. See the Publishing Tools chapter for more information.

Modal windows now use the name of the field and the parent as a title, and will now appear to the right of the selected field, allowing you to see what you're adding to the field as you add it. (3.2.2)

.. image:: images/modal.gif


Multiple modal windows will stack to the right to make sure the field remains visible. Close the current active modal by clicking the X in the upper right corner, or press Escape to close all modals at once. (3.2.2)

The algorithm for finding users in the Users & Roles section has been improved.

The improved Hotspot interface replaces the right "Edit Hotspot" menu with a less intrusive pop-up menu.

Embedded objects can now be multi-selected.

Publishing Improvements
=======================

The process of creating, saving, and publishing your content has been streamlined and simplified. Please see the updated :doc:`../../../editorial-guide/publishing-process/all` chapter for more detail. (3.2.2)
