Sizes and Texts Tab
-------------------

Brightspot permits you to use the same image in a variety of ways and locations. The size and aspect ratio of the image might not be appropriate for every use, so Brightspot makes it easy to choose the right crop for your purpose.

Standard Image Sizes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A variety of predefined crops are created by your administrators to fit your site's design. Brightspot refers to these presets as Standard Image Sizes. To choose the Standard Image Size that's right for your content, go to the Sizes & Texts tab in the Edit Image interface. The scrollable column to the right of your selected image shows you the available Standard Image Sizes and a preview of how your image looks with each crop. To refine the crop, you can resize while maintaining the correct image ratio by clicking and dragging the corner of the box overlaid on the image and reposition by clicking and dragging the box itself. For the best results, make sure that your image is at least the size of the crop you're planning to use.

Adding Text
~~~~~~~~~~~

Brightspot allows you to overlay your image with text, like a headline, pull quote, or link. After you've selected a Standard Image Size in the Sizes and Texts tab, "+ Add Text" appears over the sample image. The text tool can place text anywhere on an image, and retains the same powerful feature set as any other Rich Text field in Brightspot. Text added only applies to the currently selected Standard Image Size.
